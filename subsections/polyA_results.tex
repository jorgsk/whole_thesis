What results should you present? Anything more than was presented in the paper?

The figure with the compartments and poly(A)-.

Shows two things: 1) there is poly(A) signal in poly(A)- extract. explained by
errors in screening and by that some poly(A) sequences are short after library
treatment. 2) intronic polyadenylation in the nucleus overrepresented. Makes
sense if there is nuclear degradation of intronic poly(A) which has been
recently shown.

Then the figure with overlap to show how much you get?

Then the figure that shows the flattening out of the getting of new
transcripts.

Discuss each of the tree figures and that's it.

Maybe make a table with some of the numbers from the statistics you output.

Then cite the paper.
