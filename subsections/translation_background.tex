Transcription of a gene can lead to a myriad of RNA species, collectively
called a cell's transcriptome. While the RNA all consist of the same four
basepairs, they get different names depending on their fate after
transcription. The list of RNA species is ever growing, and includes for
example small noncoding RNA (snRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), and
antisense RNA (aRNA), in addition to the well established ribosomal RNA (rRNA),
transfer RNA (tRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA).
