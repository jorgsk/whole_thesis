I have many people to thank for helping me get through the past four years in
good (or decent) shape. First I have to thank my main advisor, Nadav Bar, for
hiring me and giving me a chance to see what the world of research is all
about.

Second of all I would like to thank my fellow PhD students at NTNU for their
help and friendship. From Chemical Enginering I thank Deeptanshu for all the
good discussions and culiary experiences, Johannes for talking about window
managers and climbing, Ivan for teaching me \textit{rude}mentary Italian while
finishing his thesis, Olaf for insisting that I start using Linux and for
warning me about the pitfalls of PhD-life, Bjørn-Tore for many, many climbing
sessions, and Maryam and Ismael for good company and discussions. From
Biotechnology I thank Rahmi for suggesting I should check out Python and for
leading me to the work of Lillian Hsu, and Veronika and Simone for explaining
lots of biology and for good collaboration.

Thirdly I owe a great \textit{moltes grácies} to Roderic Guigó and his group at
the CRG in Barcelona. I came to you in a difficult stage in my PhD and you took
me along from the very beginning. Staying at a professional and international
research institute like the CRG was an eye-opener for me in terms of how
research can be done and what a high level and productive research environment
looks like. Thanks to Roderic, Pedro, Rory, Sarah, Angelika, David, Maik, and
all the rest for teaching me about bioinformatics and genomics.

Fourthly I thank Martin Kuiper for becoming my co-supervisor during the last
year of my PhD and for helping me getting through to the end. Your help
mattered a lot when I made the transition from the CRG back to the NTNU and
also in the final stages of writing the thesis.

Toward the end, I thank my mother and my father in Troms\o and my sister now in
Oslo. You have always supported me and made my life easy so that I could focus
on the things I wanted to do. Thank you so much for that.

Finally and most importantly, I thank my dear Itziar for her ever-positive
spirits, happy smiles, and for reminding me time and time again about what is
important in life. Thanks for listening to my ramblings about some topic or
another in molecular biology and for explaining so many things. Thank you for
making my life easy and happy and for inspiring me with your imagination and
creativity.
