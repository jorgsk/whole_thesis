The cell is considered to be the unit of life. A single celled organism manages
by itself to absorb nutrients from its environment and uses those nutrients to
navigate itself and to replicate itself. On the surface, life is then about
consuming nutrients and replicating. It is possible to stop with this
understanding of life and move on. But if we want to understand how the cell
uses these external metabolites like sugars and fatty acids to drive cell
division and cellular locomotion -- and we do -- then we must look under the
surface to the cell interior. Inside the cell we see a crowded milieu of DNA,
RNA, and protein molecules in constant collision and reaction. But we also see
a system to the chaos, and that system begins with DNA being the blueprint or
the instruction set from which all cellular programs are executed. Ultimately,
the DNA blueprint is used to produce RNA and protein molecules that through
interactions on the micro scale are able to cause macro scale changes such as
cell division or motility.

Genes are the discrete parts of DNA which are copied into RNA, and gene
expression is another term for RNA and protein production. Gene expression
consist broadly of two stages: DNA transcription, in which an RNA copy is made
from DNA, and RNA translation, in which a protein is created based on
instructions in the RNA. For some genes, gene expression stops after
transcription. Here, the RNA is on its own competent to perform a regulatory
role. In this work however, we will mostly deal with RNA that is translated to
protein. By carrying a protein message, these RNAs are called messenger RNA
(mRNA).

A basic property of gene expression is that it is carefully regulated. The
bacterial cell \textit{Eschericia coli} contains roughly 4000 genes, but at a
given time only a subset of these are expressed. The choice of which genes to
express at a given time depends on the environmental condition the cell finds
itself in.

In this work, we study the regulation of gene expression at different stages of
the process. Specifically, we study the i) initiation of transcription, ii) the
termination of transcription, and iii) the initiation of translation. The work
on transcription and translation initiation has been done on bacterial cells,
while the work on transcription termination has been done on human cells.

In the introduction, there will be a review of those phases transcription and
translation that are relevant for the work that has been done. The review will
cover both the biological and computational/theoretical background needed to
read the thesis as a whole.
