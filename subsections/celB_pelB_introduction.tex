Here I should write about my contribution to that paper. No more than one page.
Maybe include additional unpublished results?

\subsubsection{Summary of the paper and my contribution}
The publication by Kucharova et al. is about heterologous expression of the
inf-a2b gene. The problem was that a codon optimized version of the inf-a2b
gene was not expressed in the \textit{E. coli host}, but the addition of the
pelB N-terminal tag provided expression.

My contribution to the paper was first to rule out a that pelB increases
expression because of secondary structures as the ribosome binding site (RBS),
as no significant differences were found between neither the structure nor the
folding energy of the native inf-a2b and the pelB version (fig this, fig that).

In spite of this, secondary structures could still be limiting the expression
of the original inf-a2b gene. My second contribution was to construct a library
of variations of the inf-a2b gene where all possible synonymous mutations in
the first nine codons were present. I screened this library with respect to
folding energy of the extended RBS and codon usage. Veronika tested out several
of the candiants in the library with the lowest folding energy. The result of
this was that we now obtained expression of the inf-a2b gene at the transcript
level; some of the variants even achieved higher transcript expression than
pelB-inf-a2b. However these variants were not detected at the protein level.
This showed that there are at least two barriers to expression of inf-a2b in
\textit{E. coli}; one at the stage of translation initiation, and another
downstream step.

Additional experiments that were not published show that pelB is not limited
at transcription initiation?
