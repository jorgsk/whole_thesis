Gene expression -- the synthesis of RNA and protein -- requires most of the
cell's energy and is a highly regulated process at all its levels. In this
thesis, three studies are presented which focus on the regulation of three
different levels of gene expression. One is centered on the regulation of
transcription initiation; the other on translation initiation; while the
third looks at RNA post-transcriptional processing. The studies are integrated
in the way that they illustrate how DNA sequences directly affect regulation at
these three different levels. The studies rely on different experimental data,
however, and require different theoretical techniques of analysis.

The study on transcription initiation is about how the RNA polymerase (RNAP)
takes the step from promoter binding to promoter escape. Before reaching
promoter escape, RNAP may undergo abortive initiation, in which the nascent RNA
transcript is released from RNAP. At many promoters, RNAP undergoes repeated
abortive initiation, known as abortive cycling, before promoter escape is
reached. The DNA sequence composition of the 20 first transcribed basepairs has
been known to affect the efficiency of promoter escape, presumably by affecting the
probabilities of abortive initiation, but the mechanism for this effect was not
known. Using a thermodynamic model of transcription initiation, we have shown
that the manner in which RNAP translocates during initial
transcription explains the observed variation in promoter escape efficiency on
the N25 promoter. The key variable for linking translocation of RNAP during
initiation and promoter escape efficiency was the sequence of the RNA 3\ppp
dinucleotide, and not the free energy of the DNA bubble which had been
postulated by others. We proceed to verify our findings with follow-up
experiments, in which we used our thermodynamic model to construct N25 promoter
variants with predicted promoter escape efficiencies. The experiments agreed
well with the predictions, making a strong argument for translocation during
initial RNA synthesis as the major determinant of promoter escape efficiency.

The study on translation initiation focuses on the problem of heterologous
expression of the human \textit{inf-$\alpha$2b} gene in \textit{E.\ coli}. A
known bottleneck for heterologous gene expression is the binding of the
ribosome to a folded translation initiation region on a messenger RNA.
Therefore, we introduced silent mutations in the first 9 codons of
\textit{inf-$\alpha$2b} that were predicted to reduce the free energy of RNA
secondary structures at the ribosome binding site to different degrees. This
approach produced some \textit{inf-$\alpha$2b} variants which showed an 
increased amount of \textit{inf-$\alpha$2b} transcript, indicating that
translation initiation is likely a strong barrier for the expression of this
gene in an \textit{E.\ coli} host.

In the third study, we focused on the process of 3\ppp cleavage and
polyadenylation of eukaryote RNAs. Cleavage and polyadenylation make up a part
of pre-RNA processing of many eukaryote RNAs, and is required for mRNA
stability and transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. To study 3\ppp
cleavage and polyadenylation, we analyzed RNA sequencing data to identify
polyadenylation sites in transcripts from different cell compartments across 12
human cell lines. We found over 160.000 polyadenylation sites, only 80\% of
which were previously annotated. In addition we found an unexpected enrichment
of polyadenylation sites in intronic regions of nuclear RNA. We offer a
discussion on how these sites may be signals of polyadenylation-related nuclear
degradation.

We have employed two different approaches in our investigation of the three
different aspects of gene regulation: a gene-centric approach for transcription
and translation initiation, and a genome-centric approach for 3\ppp cleavage
and polyadenylation. This has resulted in different types of research questions
being asked, different computational challenges, and different sorts of
results, with the gene-centric results being more mechanism oriented, and the
genome-centric being more general.

The main conclusion of the thesis is that free energy calculations of RNA and
DNA nucleotide chains are useful tools in combination with traditional
molecular biology techniques; we base this on our successful investigations of
the relationship between gene sequence and gene expression for RNAP-dependent
transcription initiation and ribosome-dependent translation initiation.
