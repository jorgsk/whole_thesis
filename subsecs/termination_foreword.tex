This section contains the background material for the work on detecting 3\ppp
cleavage and polyadenylation from RNA-seq data. Part of this analysis is
included in the paper by Djebali et al.\ on page \pageref{landscape}. The
remainder of the analysis is found in chapter \ref{chap:polyA} on page
\pageref{chap:polyA}. In this review, we will first cover the eukaryotic
transcription process in general, and then focus in particular on transcription
termination. Second, we will describe the process of 3\ppp cleavage and
polyadenylation. Thirdly we review genome-wide studies that have investigated
3\ppp cleavage and polyadenylation. Finally we briefly review the RNA-seq
technology used to generate the data, since some steps in the RNA-seq protocol
affect to what degree polyadenylation sites are available in the final data.
