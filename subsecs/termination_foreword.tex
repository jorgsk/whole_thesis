This section contains the background material for the analysis of cleavage and
polyadenylation from RNA-seq data in chapter \ref{chap:polyA}. Part of this
analysis is included in the paper by Djebali et al.\ on page
\pageref{landscape}. In this review, we will first cover the eukaryotic
transcription process in general, and then focus in particular on transcription
termination, with emphasis on the process of 3\ppp cleavage and
polyadenylation. Thirdly we review genome-wide studies that have investigated
3\ppp cleavage and polyadenylation. Finally we briefly review the RNA-seq
technology used to generate the data, since some steps in the RNA-seq protocol
affect to what degree polyadenylation sites may be identified from this type of
sequence data.
