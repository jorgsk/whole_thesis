In this section we describe how the computational results in this thesis
can be reproduced. The source code for the different projects is too
large to be physically included in the thesis, and as such is stored on
the source code hosting site Github (\nolinkurl{www.github.com}). The
source code is being made publicly available on Github as the articles
from each project are published. At the time of writing, the source
codes for chapters \ref{chap:initiation_paper} and \ref{chap:celB} are
not yet publicly available.

To obtain the source code from Github, the program \textit{git} must be
installed (\nolinkurl{www.git-scm.com}). Use git from the command line
to obtain the code like this:

\begin{verbatim}
git clone git@github.com:jorgsk/exampleProject.git
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
The Github locations for the different projects are given below:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Translation initiation project (chapter \ref{chap:celB}):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[] \nolinkurl{git@github.com:jorgsk/translation_initiation.git}
		\end{itemize}
	\item Transcription initiation project (chapter \ref{chap:initiation_paper}):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[] \nolinkurl{git@github.com:jorgsk/transcription_initiation.git}
		\end{itemize}
	\item 3\ppp cleavage and polyadenylation (chapter \ref{chap:polyA}):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[] \nolinkurl{git@github.com:jorgsk/Utail.git}
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

After downloading the code for each project, see the readme-file for each
project for further instructions. The readme-file contains instructions for
running the source code as well as a list of software dependencies for each
project. However, all projects have the following common requirements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Modern Linux distribution (i.e. Ubuntu Linux)
	\item Python version 2.7+
	\item The Python libraries
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[] Numpy (version 1.5+)
			\item[] Scipy (version 0.9+)
			\item[] Matplotlib (version 1.0+)
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
