A requirement for reproducing the results in this thesis is running a
Unix/Linux variant like Ubuntu. Each project has additional requirements for
software that must be installed, which is detailed in the README files for each
project.

The source code necessary to reproduce the computational results from each
chapter is made available on the hosting site Github.com as the articles
produced from each project are published. In the time of writing, only the
Github page for the 3\ppp cleavage and polyadenylation project is unlocked.

To obtain the source code from github.com, the program \textit{git} must be
installed. Use git from the command line like this:

\begin{verbatim}
git clone git@github.com:jorgsk/exampleProject.git
\end{verbatim}

The Github locations for the different projects are given below:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Transcription initiation project (chapter X):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item git@github.com:jorgsk/transcription_initiation.git
		\end{itemize}
	\item Transcription initiation project (chapter X):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item git@github.com:jorgsk/translation_initiation.git 
		\end{itemize}
	\item 3\ppp cleavage and polyadenylation (chapter X):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item git@github.com:jorgsk/Utail.git
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
