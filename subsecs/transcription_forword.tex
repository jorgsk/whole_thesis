Two articles by Skancke et al.\ cover the kinetics of transcription by promoter
bound RNAP (chapter \ref{chap:kinetic_paper}) and sequence-determinants for the
efficiency of promoter escape (chapter \ref{chap:initiation_paper}). In this
section we review the computational and biological aspects relevant for the
articles. We cover promoter binding and transcription initiation in detail, and
then briefly discuss the elongation phase of transcription. At the end of the
section, we review computational modeling of transcription, both for initiation
and elongation.
