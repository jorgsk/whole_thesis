The article by Skancke et al.\ in chapter \ref{chap:initiation_paper} on page
\pageref{chap:initiation_paper} concerns how the efficiency of promoter escape
depends on the transcription of the initial transcribed sequence. In this section we
review the computational and biological aspects relevant for the paper. We
cover promoter binding and transcription initiation in detail, and then briefly
discuss the elongation phase of transcription. At the end of the section, we
review computational modeling of transcription, both for elongation and
initiation.
