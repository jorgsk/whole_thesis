The articles by Skancke et al.\ in chapters \ref{chap:initiation_paper} and
\ref{chap:kinetic_paper} cover the kinetics of transcription by promoter bound
RNAP and sequence-determinants for the efficiency of promoter escape. In this
section we review the computational and biological aspects relevant for the
articles. We cover promoter binding and transcription initiation in detail,
and then briefly discuss the elongation phase of transcription. At the end of
the section, we review computational modeling of transcription, both for
elongation and initiation.
