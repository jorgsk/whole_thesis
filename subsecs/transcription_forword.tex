The article by Skancke et al.\ in chapter \ref{chap:initiation_paper} on page
\pageref{chap:initiation_paper} is about how the efficiency of promoter escape
depends on how transcription progresses for the first 20 nucleotides. In this
section we review the relevant topics for the paper. We cover promoter binding
and transcription initiation in detail, and then briefly cover transcription
elongation and transcription for completeness.  At the end, we briefly review
computational modeling of transcription, both during elongation and during
initiation.
